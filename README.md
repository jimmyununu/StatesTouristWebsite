Overview
The Arkansas Website Project is a dynamic and responsive front-end application showcasing 
information about cities in Arkansas. The project was initially tailored to highlight Little 
Rock but has since been expanded to support multiple cities using a generalized .city-page 
class. Its design focuses on accessibility, scalability, and user experience, making it 
suitable for users on both desktop and mobile devices.
